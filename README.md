## More about this project

It is base on openresty and dbhys/openresty-stage images.

## How to use

Notice: you must add $PREFIX dir to the lua_package_path in your conf/nginx.conf. the example is in the [conf/nginx.conf](conf/nginx.conf). actually, the $prefix is the dir behind "openresty -p", in our image it is the same as $PREFIX.

### Mount workdir

If you don't want to change anything of the container, just run your lua code, the best way is mount your workdir
to the container workdir(/usr/local/stage), and the dir must contain the file conf/nginx.conf

### From this image

You can build your own image from this image, May be just replace those enviroment variables or commands (PREFIX, COPY, EXPOSE...)
